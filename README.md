# Hum or Whistle Song Identification #
* Using the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jesusrequena/mlend-hums-and-whistles), I used various machine learning techniques to categorise hum or whistle sound bites
* Labelled and cleaned data
* Extracted audio features from audio files
* Hyperparameters tuned using grid search and k-fold cross validation
* Evaluated models with confusion matrices and training/validation accuracies
## Basic solution ##
Used support vector machine and k-nearest neighbour to classify audio as the Harry Potter theme tune or the star wars Imperial March
## Advanced Solution #
* Attempted to predict incorrectly named recordings
* Used support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour, logistic regression and random forest models
